# Goals

1. Get better at Vim
2. Demonstrate to potential employers I know what I'm talking about 

# Architecture

## Frontend

The site that visitors see will be pure html, but the site will be editable via a react admin interface. Need to figure out how to deliver and host bothat the same address.

## Backend

Backend will have a few different operations, such as generating the pure html site from the backend, triggering cache refreshes, and handling db operations.

Will use mongo db.
